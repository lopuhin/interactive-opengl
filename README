Interactive OpenGL console
==========================

This app lets you enter OpenGL commands and evaluate them with a single key or button press. You can walk across your scene, draw current coordinate grid if you like, export the resulting image.

TODO:
 * move through the scene
 * tabs
 * revamp UI: more buttons or no buttons, refresh by F5, proper initial size
 * // comments, highlighting them
